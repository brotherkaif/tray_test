# Tray.io Test 
## Potenial Typo
I think that there may have been a typo in the [original spec](https://gist.github.com/DavidJSimpsonEsq/71dcf396a2303ad5edd08690289d016d) for the task.

In the **Output** section of the spec, it states that the expected output for the example input given should be:
```
1 3
1
```
However, when running through the intended movement behaviour of the robot, the final output should be:
```
3 3
1
```
As I am working on this challenge out of office hours, getting clarification on this would have delayed things by another day. Therefore in the interest of time, I have proceeded to implement the robot in the way in which I have interpreted the spec. I hope that this is okay.
